# K-Means-Clustering : The K-means clustering algorithm is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data, It should be able to deal with different types of data,A good clustering solution will remove Noise and Outliers.
*In this,we have to findout the clusters in the wine data set by using K-Means Clustering.
1. Firstly we need to do preprocessing by scaling the dataset, 
2. Then we need to take two features to performing Clustering,
3. We need to find the Centroids with the help of clusters,
4. Capturing Inertia--The total sum of squared distances of every data point from respective centroid is also called inertia.
5. then we have to findout the silhouette score,
6. The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
